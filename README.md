**Note:**

* Notable hyperparameters that can be trained in later as the Houghcircle parameters may vary
* List of hyperparameters
> * Parameter1(25, 100)
> * Parameter2(75, 30)
> * Reduction ratio(for both outer and inner detection(500, 350)
> * Min radius(dynamic, 10), Max radius(dynamic, 25)
> * Use of filters(Though Gaussian Blur worked here)
> * Advanced Denoising Techniques should be implied
